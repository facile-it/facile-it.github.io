      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the latest Venerdì Protetto (held on March 8, 2024), we had to change slightly the schedule we&amp;rsquo;d planned.&#xA;We had to face a new schedule with very strict time constraints. So we decided to&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;do something new&lt;/em&gt;, and try a Code Challenge!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how did we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We searched for something already done on the internet, and most suitable for our needs.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-this-post-about&#34;&gt;What is this post about?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Developing a project or a product implies, for the engineering teams, the need to make many decisions to reach their goals. Therefore, the teams are often faced with an inevitable and usually not-so-exciting step: capturing and recording significant decisions. This post will give you a taste of what it takes to make decisions during project or product development and will provide you with a standard that can be used in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
