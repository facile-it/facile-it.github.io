      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this article is to define basic concepts related to testing, trying not to take anything for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-do-we-test&#34;&gt;Why do we test??&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why is it important to write automated tests? I asked myself and I did some research because the answer to this question was not obvious to me. I knew it was important but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why. So, I decided to try to explain it starting from a point of view as impartial as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
