      <description>During the latest Venerdì Protetto on December 13th, Facile.it hosted a software architecture exercise called Architecture Kata with some of our lead developers.
Architectural Katas are small-group exercises. A moderator assigns each group a different project that needs development, keeps track of time and acts as the facilitator. To learn about Architectural Katas, see https://nealford.com/katas/.
During the exercise, each team had a meeting to discover additional requirements, discuss possible technology options, and sketch out a rough vision of the solution.</description>

      <description>«Learn or die». These are the words with which Codemotion Milan 2016 started on the 25th of November. Most of our development team attended this tech conference like the previous year. Moreover Facile.it was present at the event as a sponsor with his stand looking for new talent.
During the event we also officially announced the second #FacileHack hackathon, which is planned for march 2017.
This post would be a short recap of some talks in chronological order.</description>
