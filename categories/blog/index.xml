      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, we went through a bit of a restyling in the last few days, and our blog changed a lot in terms of appearance and structure.&#xA;We are very happy with those changes, but the reason behind this transition is not just a simple template change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-we-were-searching-for&#34;&gt;What we were searching for&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before, we were using an hosted CMS to run the blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. We were happy with the results, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our concern to administrate the server or bother about other hosting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
