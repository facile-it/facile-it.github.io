      <title>Using Kotlin type-safe builders to create a DSL for Forms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Facile.it we are constantly dealing with a lot of &lt;strong&gt;forms&lt;/strong&gt;: we use them to collect various information and data needed to feed our in-house comparing algorithms. These forms could be &lt;strong&gt;really complex&lt;/strong&gt;, having multiple rules and dependencies between fields, and they are likely to be &lt;strong&gt;changed and tuned frequently&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I joined Facile.it, a lot of forms within the Android app needed to be updated or modified and sticking with the existing strategy would have required me to do &lt;strong&gt;a lot of work&lt;/strong&gt; just to add or remove a simple field. So I took a step back and I started thinking about a strategy that would have allowed me to define and structure a form in a more &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; way. I wanted to be able to declare the &lt;strong&gt;relationships&lt;/strong&gt; between fields, their &lt;strong&gt;validation rules&lt;/strong&gt; and their &lt;strong&gt;serialized representation&lt;/strong&gt; (how they are sent to the server).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
