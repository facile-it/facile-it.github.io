      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the successful experience of &lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/v-protetto8-3-2024/&#34; title=&#34;Previously, on Venerd√¨ Protetto... a code challenge!&#34;&gt;having a code challenge in March 2024&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to go further in delivering experiences to our colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scouting around, I turned to Alessio Giorgianni, a developer with a passion for white hat hacking competition. We agree to try an experience using a platform called &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.hackthebox.com/&#34;&gt;Hack the Box&lt;/a&gt;. Hack the Box Academy offers lots of information and training about IT Security and, in our case, some exercises we can use for hacking dummy applications, with a whitebox example (i.e., an example where all the code is undisclosed to us. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/penetration-testing/black-box-gray-box-and-white-box-penetration-testing-importance-and-uses/#:~:text=Objectives%3A%20Black%2Dbox%20testers%20seek,somewhere%20between%20these%20two%20extremes&#34;&gt;There are also different kind of pentest&lt;/a&gt;). We agreed upon using a non-trivial quest, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hackthebox.com/achievement/challenge/48545/638&#34;&gt;Jerrytok&lt;/a&gt;. Jerrytok is a WAPT (Web App Penetration Testing) whitebox challenge. We got a simple web-application, written in PHP, which disclose the harm of using template engines in a not-proper way. It&amp;rsquo;s a good introduction to SSTI, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection&#34;&gt;Server Side Template Injection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
