      <description>Here at Facile.it we are constantly dealing with a lot of forms: we use them to collect various information and data needed to feed our in-house comparing algorithms.

When I joined Facile.it, a lot of forms within the Android app needed to be updated or modified and sticking with the existing strategy would have required me to do a lot of work just to add or remove a simple field.</description>

      <description>Premise Java is an old programming language. Version 1.0 was released in 1996 by Sun Microsystems and even though it has evolved and grown a lot over the past twenty years it is still carrying on some bad design choices such as null (ask Tony Hoare), primitive types or lack of a proper function type. With the last version of the language (Java 8) Java tried to address some of these problems introducing concepts such as Optional or lambda expression.</description>
