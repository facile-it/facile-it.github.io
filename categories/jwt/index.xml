      <description>When I started my study about JWT, I was searching for a smart method to authenticate a request, without querying the database each time to check the applicant reliability. I needed a token or something similar with the ability to validate itself and flexible enough to customize the validation strategy. Imagine for example a web application where a user can login and obtain a &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo; with his name and an expiration time, and this pass will let him ask for resources until the pass expires, and only if the issuer is trusted.</description>
