      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, Facile attended for the first time &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2020&#34;&gt;Lambda Days&lt;/a&gt; Conference in the beautiful polish city of Krakow.&#xA;It has been a two-days full immersion with speakers coming from all over the world.&#xA;The latest trends and academic research in the functional world were showcased, spanning from beginner&amp;rsquo;s approaches to functional languages to highly specific scientific applications.&#xA;This conference was totally worth attending, albeit very intense (sometimes mind-bending, actually!). All the talks were of high quality and the organization was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
