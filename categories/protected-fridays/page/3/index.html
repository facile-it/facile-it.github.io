  "articleBody": "This page contains the abstracts of the talks held during the latest Venerdì Protetto on September 8, 2023. Topics: Code shipping by Luca Florio (Spotify) Community tools by Giovanni Cardamone Quix Streams Library by Thomas Neubauer (Quix) The overview of Venerdì Protetto is available here. Code Shipping Ship it! From your laptop to production multiple times a day By Luca Florio, Spotify Shipping code We all love to ship our code to production as fast as possible. But how to ensure (well, kind of) that we are not breaking stuff? In the talk, we explored how to implement a CI/CD pipeline to bring the code from our laptops to our servers in the cloud in a safe way. We covered testing, PR review, infrastructure as a code, canary analysis, and all the safeguards that make it hard to take our service down by mistake. Oh, and we need to keep it up and running after we deploy it as well. That is important too, right? Community Tools A place where we can meet By Giovanni Cardamone, Facile.it Community tools Community Tools is an initiative to create a unified community within Facile.it. The key points are improving, having fun, and bringing value to everyone. The initiative focuses on introducing new tools to the company to build a nicer working environment and better integrate into the "Facile lifestyle". Every community member can make a difference by having a space to communicate and compare with others. Community Tools is also a place to find new stuff and learn from each other's work. New workflows, programming languages, and methodologies can be experimented with freely and without deadlines to build everything you think is missing. Quix Streams Library A Python-Kafka connector for data-intensive workloads By Thomas Neubauer, Quix Quix Streams Library This talk introduced Quix Streams, an open-source Python library for data-intensive workloads on Kafka. We discussed the unique problems that this library is designed to solve, and how it was shaped by the challenges of building a Kafka-based solution for Formula 1 cars at McLaren— a solution that needed to process a colossal firehose of sensor data coming in at thousands of samples per second. We also explained why we combined a Kafka API approach with a stream processing library and provided developers with a familiar Pandas DataFrame-like interface. We saw the library in action with a sentiment analysis demo. In this demo, we calculated sentiment scores for incoming messages in a demo chap app—all in real-time, using the HuggingFace Transformer's API. In the end, we connected to Twitter streaming API to send a high volume of data into the pipeline to simulate this use case at scale. We saw how the library can simplify tasks such as: Subscribing to topics and deserializing incoming messages into table rows. Running calculations on a rolling window of messages. Using memory states to apply different functions such as aggregation or filtering. Automatically outputting the results of calculations into downstream topics. Managing state without the hassle of checkpointing and queues. The archive of all Venerdì Protetto talks is available here.

  "articleBody":"Deserialization The attacker's point of view by Alessio Giorgianni Serialization is a known concept within software development. Nonetheless, the developer often has only a superficial knowledge of this mechanism, ignoring especially the security-related issues. So, what might happen if a skilled attacker is able to manipulate a serialized payload maliciously? The purpose of this talk was to give an introductory overview of the potential attack scenarios that a user attacker could implement, and the consequences they could have (arbitrary file read/write, remote code execution, etc.) by focusing more on the PHP platform. We started by writing From great power comes great responsibility, as Uncle Ben said. And that's true when you use a Kubernetes cluster shared among multiple tenants. In this session, we discovered the principles required to develop an Internal Developer Platform that is multi-tenant aware such as self-service, security first, and declarative, besides the API primitives that Kubernetes offers to address the resource quota and isolation. Eventually, we discovered how Capsule can help to address all these requirements in a simpler way, without breaking the Kubernetes UX. Machine learning pipelines at Facile.it by Luigi Cerone & Jacopo Demichelis - simple introductory exploits and worked our way up to a complex exploit used in a recent bug from the well-known blog VBullettin. Kubernetes multi-tenancy by Dario Tranchitella Building a machine learning (ML) model could be challenging, but being able to handle its lifecycle in production at scale is a whole different problem. In this talk, we shared what’s behind the curtain of many of the ML models in production at Facile.it. We started from an existing use case, that is, the optimization of leads. We then covered both the creation of the models and all the technical solutions, pipelines, and procedures created in the last year to keep them updated and monitored.

    "articleBody": "AsyncAPI Initiative: Async APIs and Event-Driven Architecture. Working with Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is difficult, especially when you need to retrieve documentation of the messages sent, find who is consuming or publishing a specific message, and so on. What if there was a specification that allows developers, architects, and product managers to define the interfaces of an async API, as OpenAPI does for REST APIs? AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architecture. The long-term goal is to make working with EDAs as easy as working with REST APIs. That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management. Most of the processes you apply to your REST APIs today could also apply to your event-driven/asynchronous APIs. In this talk, we presented the main concepts behind the AsyncAPI specification, the tools we can use to save time, and a small example. Generative Artificial Intelligence: A Practical Primer. In this talk, we delved into the world of Generative AI, defining its place in the broader AI landscape and exploring the capabilities and applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). We discussed the underlying principles behind Generative AI and highlighted its practical use cases, from question answering to code generation. We covered emerging patterns with which LLMs are being integrated into larger software applications. Additionally, we addressed the risks associated with Generative AI and provided some recommendations on how to mitigate them. Unveiling the Power of User Stories: Essential Techniques for Successful Software Development. Explore the transformative potential of user stories in Agile software development. This talk covered the why and how of user stories, including their origins, benefits, and common templates. We discovered the 3 C's framework for effective story crafting and the INVEST principle for actionable stories. We also gained insights into user story mapping, splitting, and refinement techniques. Attendees left equipped with practical knowledge to leverage user stories for improved collaboration, iteration, and successful software development.",

  "articleBody":"API testing with Prism and Playwright Today's software landscape is highly competitive and users are increasingly reluctant to tolerate unreliable applications. An issue at the API level of an application can lead to user-facing errors or latency, which can erode customer trust, lead to churn, and negatively impact the business. This puts tremendous pressure on development teams to deliver consistently available, high-performing APIs. With the Prism proxy tool ([Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)) we can validate requests and responses against a model and achieve clean and correct documentation ([OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)). By writing tests through Playwright we can test different aspects of an API from request to response. During the talk, we discussed the following points: - What is API Testing? - Prism
- 10 API testing tips - How to develop test API? - Running API tests - Swagger-PHP (Zircote)
- Prism error types - Playwright test examples Using openAI APIs in a custom knowledge base   
This talk introduced the study of the potential of the artificial intelligence models exposed by OpenAI using chatGPT APIs in a React project, both without a custom knowledge base and with a restricted and specific knowledge base. In this talk, we learned what the learning models used by ChatGPT are. We saw a brief list of the models exposed by OpenAI and talked about tokenization and pricing. Furthermore, we saw the completions API i.e. the core API of the technology and verified the functioning of summarization, sentiment analysis and classification through a demo. We then saw a Python script within which we queried the model on data provided as input, requesting the same set of capabilities in a custom knowledge base. To learn more, take a look at these resources: - [How To Build Your Own Custom ChatGPT With Custom Knowledge Base](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-build-your-own-custom-chatgpt-with-custom-knowledge-base-4e61ad82427e) - [Llama Hub](https://llamahub.ai/) - [Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) Agile working, information technologies, and mental health - an introduction With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide governments enforced lockdown measures to contain the health crisis; this hurried many companies to adopt and enhance agile/remote work practices, in which information technologies played a pivotal role. Implementing such practices required heavy regulatory, logistical, infrastructural, and organizational changes, the acquisition of new skills and habits, and a new way to conceive work. Though challenging at first, these changes proved beneficial for both the organizations and the individual workers, with long-lasting consequences even after overcoming the critical phase of the pandemic. However, many concerns were raised regarding several issues, including workers' mental health and its impact from both an individual and organizational standpoint. The talk aimed to tackle the psychological aspects of agile work and the information technologies used to enable it, by focusing on its main emotional, cognitive, and relational dimensions and providing some strategies to address the most critical issues.

  "articleBody":"An introduction to Backstage, managing the chaos At the beginning of this year, our engineering teams adopted a new tool: Backstage, an open-source platform for building developer portals created at Spotify. During this Venerdì Protetto, we had the opportunity to host Lee Mills, a member of the Spotify engineering team. Here is a word from our guest: At Spotify, we've always believed in the speed and ingenuity that comes from having autonomous development teams. But as we learned firsthand, the faster you grow, the more fragmented and complex your software ecosystem becomes. And then everything slows down again. Introducing Backstage, a developer portal designed to tame the chaos, bring consistency, and do it all while empowering autonomy and you to make decisions. During the talk, we discussed the following points: -   Introduction to Backstage -   Extension points and potential of Backstage -   Invitation to developers to contribute to the project -   Development road map and new intriguing features to expect in future releases 
To learn more about Backstage, visit the official [Backstage website](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage/ https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage/"). Codebase restructuring with Clean Architecture and NestJS Ensuring code organization and scalability of the software regardless of the framework. If this is your goal, you as well might be interested in the topic of Clean Architecture and its application in the context of software development. In this talk, we learned how the Clean Architecture can be framework-independent and how it has been integrated into server-side applications in Node.js: NestJS. In particular, we explored how the NestJS approach to creating modules, services, and controllers can be used to implement a project structure based on the Clean Architecture. We also discussed how the dependency injection pattern of NestJS can be used to implement greater modularity within the Clean Architecture, allowing better separation of responsibilities and greater testability of the code. To learn more, read one of the articles about this topic: -   [Clean architecture with Nest.js](https://medium.com/@jonathan.pretre91/clean-architecture-with-nestjs-e089cef65045 "https://medium.com/@jonathan.pretre91/clean-architecture-with-nestjs-e089cef65045") -   [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html "https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html") -   [The Clean Architecture - Beginner's Guide](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-clean-architecture-beginners-guide-e4b7058c1165 "https://betterprogramming.pub/the-clean-architecture-beginners-guide-e4b7058c1165") Using React with in-house libraries Creating a simple yet flexible and powerful form structure is always a topic of interest in front-end development, especially during an intensive rewriting and refactoring of the codebase. In this talk, we learned about a need that emerged during the migration to React.js, carried out by our Gas & Power Team. In that circumstance, the team needed to create a set of forms for the Facile.it internal checkout. The forms had to have several similarities but also some differences, depending on the company and the offer. Rather than having many similar components or one that was too complex, our engineers chose to describe the forms through a unique configuration. They consequently built a component capable of designing the modules according to that unique configuration. For this purpose, they used two libraries of the Facile.it design system: Full Metal UI (FMUI) for layout and design of the form via custom components and Bilden for validation. This approach to creating forms was successfully applied to the internal checkout and the code was imported into a common library. 
The talk included some practical examples of the use of this common library and a mini-workshop during which we had the opportunity to design forms.
