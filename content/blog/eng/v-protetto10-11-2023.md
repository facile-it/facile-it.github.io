## Event sourcing

### Event sourcing with Laravel

Event sourcing and Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): Everyone talks about them, but nobody applies them. It's too difficult, they say. For some, it's like hitting a fly with a cannon.

But what if it's not?

In this talk, we saw that, thanks to Spatie's 'laravel-event-sourcing' library, setting up a project in 'event sauce' is anything but complicated. This method allowed us to achieve some interesting benefits.

The talk was divided into two parts. The first part gave the theoretical background of the methodology and the concepts used in the library. In the second part, we saw how these concepts can be applied in practice using the library.

## Playwright

### Hands-on and best practices

Deploying a quality product requires an efficient testing process that relies on an excellent testing tool.

For this reason, in this talk, we introduced Microsoft Playwright, an open-source automation framework for web applications announced in January 2020. Microsoft Playwright has a very active and enthusiastic community, and fixes and new features are released every month or less. It supports programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, C# and Java, although its main API was originally written in Node.js.

In this talk, we explored the main concepts and features of Playwright with code examples to allow participants to use it quickly and easily.

We, the test automation team at Facile.it, use Playwright for our functional testing because it is a powerful and configurable tool that can be easily integrated into our codebase.

## Project IDEA and PoC

### Project IDEA and PoC guidelines: Let your voice be heard!

Ideas are an ever-present element in every company and the basis of multiple aspects of innovation. At Facile.it, we have understood the importance of managing ideas and approaching them in a pragmatic and agile way.

A winning idea must materialize: from the idea we must move on to a proof of concept that allows us to understand the feasibility aspect. These two themes have been translated into project typologies and into rules for their definition and management, with precise limits in terms of time and number of people involved. The addition of automation for documentation completes the vision of an internal initiative that will evolve over time.
