## AI journey

### From silos to AI enterprise

<sup>by [Yuri Mariotti](https://it.linkedin.com/in/yurimariotti), [Innovazione.AI](https://innovazione.ai/chi-siamo/)<sup>

In this talk, we delved into the principles, preliminary steps, and macro-phases of a profound AI transformation in which digital best practices become the foundation of a new type of enterprise, capable of improving in (almost) every aspect thanks to the horizontal and vertical integration of Artificial Intelligence.

## Helm-based charts

### Introducing Helm-based charts

<sup>by [Alessandro Manno](https://it.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-manno-9888a55a), Facile.it<sup>

</a>

In this talk, the Facile.it DXCP team introduced Helm-based charts, a set of Helm library charts for managing Kubernetes applications.

Helm-based charts group common use cases among applications and simplify and expedite the deployment process by providing standardized and reusable components. The key advantages of Helm-based charts are centralized maintenance, uniformity in deployments across projects and teams as well as prevention of effort duplication.

After the introduction, the team presented a demo project aimed at creating project charts using helm-based charts.

## Software architecture

### Event-driven architecture

<sup>by [Sandro Toma](https://it.linkedin.com/in/sandrotoma68) & [Alessandro Cagnetti](https://it.linkedin.com/in/cagnetti), [Solace](https://solace.com/)<sup>

<a href= "/images/venerd%C3%AC_protetto/event-driven-architecture.png?raw=true" target="_blank"> 
<img align="right" style="width:45%; margin-right: 0.5em" src=/images/venerd%C3%AC_protetto/event-driven-architecture.png?raw=true" alt="Event-driven architecture" title="Event-driven architecture" /> 
</a>

Organizations want to digitally transform themselves to have real-time activities and be responsive to customer needs or market dynamics. In this respect, it has become increasingly important to adopt the Event-driven architecture or EDA approach.
At the heart of an event-driven architecture is an event broker. There are four main characteristics, in terms of capability, to consider when choosing an event broker technology:

- Continuous information distribution

- Flexible deployment

- Enterprise-level management and governance

- Ecosystem richness

In this talk, we discussed the concepts we have just defined, going into technical detail on the various aspects of a modern Event-driven architecture, thanks to the experience and different use cases that Solace has gained over many years in this regard.
