Today's software landscape is highly competitive and users are increasingly reluctant to tolerate unreliable applications. 

An issue at the API level of an application can lead to user-facing errors or latency, which can erode customer trust, lead to churn, and negatively impact the business. This puts tremendous pressure on development teams to deliver consistently available, high-performing APIs.

With the Prism proxy tool ([Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)) we can validate requests and responses against a model and achieve clean and correct documentation ([OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)). By writing tests through Playwright we can test different aspects of an API from request to response.

During the talk, we discussed the following points:

- What is API Testing?
- Prism
- 10 API testing tips
- How to develop test API?
- Running API tests
- Swagger-PHP (Zircote)
- Prism error types 
- Playwright test examples
