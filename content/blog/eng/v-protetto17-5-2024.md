## Hack the Box Workshop


After the successful experience of [having a code challenge in March 2024](https://engineering.facile.it/blog/eng/v-protetto8-3-2024/ "Previously, on Venerd√¨ Protetto... a code challenge!"), we decided to go further in delivering experiences to our colleagues.
 To try something meaningful with less organizational effort, we agreed to use a platform called [Hack the Box](https://academy.hackthebox.com/), and specifically a WAPT (Web App Penetration Testing) whitebox challenge, as a good introduction to SSTI, [Server Side Template Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection).

How we prepared it? How was it? [More information in this blog post]( ../hack-the-box-experience).

## How to develop cognitive flexibility?
In this webinar, we discovered ...

* ... some of the most common mistakes you can make when evaluating situations
* ... that NOT to follow your intuition can be highly convenient
* ... techniques that will help you develop cognitive flexibility, improving the efficacy by which you deal with complex situations
* ... books and movies that may be useful in your training journey.

Arduino Mancini, the business coach who held the webinar, well known to many at Facile, recommended having 6 toothpicks at hand during the webinar.üò≤

*The April edition of Venerd√¨ Protetto focused on company-related topics. Therefore, we didn't publish a blog post.*
