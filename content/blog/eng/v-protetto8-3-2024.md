During the last Venerdì Protetto (held on March 8, 2024), we have to change a little bit the schedule we've planned.
We have to face a new schedule with very strict time constraint. So we decided to... _do something new_, and we try a Code Challenge!

But how to do it?

Searching for something already did on the Net, the most suitable for our needs. So we tried the most obvious solution, going for... Advent of Code!

## Advent of Code - Private Leaderboard

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is an Advent Calendar, written by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) - also the creator of pages like [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) and [PHP Sadness](http://phpsadness.com/) -. Every day a little coding puzzle is purpoused, with increasing difficulty, obviously Christmas themed. 

Advent of Code is one of the most famous and well known code challenge around the web, kept every year [since 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

There are two nice features, useful for our purpouse
- *You can have a private leaderboard*, with a specific ID, where everybody can join 
- *It's language agnostic*: for every challenger, a different input is purpoused, and you just have to find the correct output. So everyone, indipendently on what job they can do, can subscribe. _Even non-strictly-tecnical person can join and try to guess a solution._

## Setting the challenge

How we prepared the challenge? It's quite straightforward

- The very day of the challenge, we *choose randomly an year*, from 2015 to 2022. We excluded the latest year, because it's too close and maybe someone can try to remember the solutions.
- We asked the challengers to form *4-persons teams*
- The challenge is: *how many point you can get in 2.5 hours*?
- and that's it!

Leaderboard manage how the points are computed and all other tedious stuff.

All teams are free to solve the puzzles in the order they want (and this was crucial for the winning team!), keeping in mind that the difficulty is ramping up from day 1 and soon you can get stuck in such a strict time-box.

# Suit up!

6 teams were formed.
They were `stderr`, `Tori Automatici` ("automated bulls"), `Ittasinanta`, `Loans&Lions`, `Daje` ("go!" in roman dialect), `Alco1isti Anon1mi`.

 The teams _in some quite eterogeneous way_, in fact they were composed in the same team by backend developers, frontend ones, data engineers, qa analysts and so on. 

Most of the participants were _newcomers_, they never made an Advent of Code before, and this was the main difficulty of some teams, one specifically. Other ones are made of veterans of this challenge, and they proceed like a wind.

## On you mark, ready, steady, go!

The challenge was very intense, and until the last 10 minutes of the challenge, it was an head to head to the first two teams.

Every single team used a [mob programming technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming#Mob_programming) way of solve problems: _the entire team_ focus itself _on a single problem_. One person actively writes the code, others suggesting solutions. This is a very interesting way to share knowledge, expecially in a never-tried setting. This is also very useful to make team building.

All teams... but one. _The winning one_.
The winning team (mainly composed of colleague from the same area) used a different approach: everyone takes a problem and try to solve it. They switch on mob programming only to solve difficult issues. This approach let they get the latest winning point solving a problem a litle further from the one everyone were stuck.

## Wrapping up

Here it is, the final score of the challenge.

*All glory to Daje team!*

Besides of the mere numbers, everyone enjoys the day, considering it though but fun. _Also, it helps people from different teams_ - and with different expertise - _wrapping up together_, knowing each others.

The challenge sharpen up collaboration and the strict time-box helps the team to focus on what matters. The side effect is, when the time almost expires, someone gave up because it was unable to focus anymore.

From the organization point of view, this was a success, even if it's a bit rough to the edges, and it needs some further fine-tuning.

And remember: Rule #1 of every challenge is to give [a very valuable prize for the winner](/images/code-challenge-march-2024/AdventOfFacileCrown.jpg)!
